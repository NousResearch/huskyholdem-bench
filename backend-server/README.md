## Introduction

The Betting Edge is a comprehensive platform designed to help users make informed betting decisions. It offers a variety of tools and data analysis features to enhance your betting experience. This server powers the core functionality of HuskyHoldem, such as signing up, running simulations, and managing user data.

## Development

### Manual Setup

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - PostgreSQL: Ensure a PostgreSQL instance is running. Update the connection settings in the application configuration.
   - Python 3.8+: Install Python on your system.

2. **Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Server**:
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8002
   ```

### Docker Setup

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Install Docker and Docker Compose on your system.

1. **Run with Docker**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   ```
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```
   This commands starts all services defined in `docker-compose.yml`, including the database, server, Redis, RabbitMQ, and three simulation workers.

## Architecture

The Betting Edge server uses a simple system with different parts working together. Hereâ€™s what we use:

- **FastAPI**: A tool to create fast and easy APIs in Python.
- **PostgreSQL**: A database to save user info, simulation results, and more.
- **Redis**: A fast storage for temporary data like caching.
- **RabbitMQ**: A tool to manage tasks like simulations, so they run smoothly.
- **Docker**: A containerization platform ensuring consistent environments across development and deployment.

### Components

- **Main Server**: Handles API requests for authentication, user management, simulation jobs, leaderboard updates, and file uploads. It interacts with PostgreSQL, Redis, and RabbitMQ.
- **Database (PostgreSQL)**: Stores all important data, like user profiles and leaderboard scores.
- **Redis**: Stores data temporarily to make things faster.
- **RabbitMQ**: Queues simulation jobs submitted by users and sends them to worker containers for processing.
- **Simulation Workers**: Three  containers (`worker_1`, `worker_2`, `worker_3`) that process simulation jobs in parallel from the RabbitMQ.

This system is easy to grow (e.g., add more workers) and works the same everywhere thanks to Docker.

## API Documentation

Once the server is running, access the interactive API documentation at `http://localhost:8002/docs` or visit `https://api.atcuw.org/docs` . This provides detailed endpoint information, request/response schemas, and a testing interface.

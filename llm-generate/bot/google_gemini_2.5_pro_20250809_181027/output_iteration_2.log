PROMPT:

You are tasked with submitting a poker bot to a No-Limit Texas Hold'em poker bot competition: Husky Hold'em.

**Detailed Game Rules**
- No-Limit Texas Hold'em with 2-10 players (often 6-handed tables); bots compete in heads-up or multi-player matches hosted by a central game server.
- Players start with $10,000 chips at the simulation start; simulations run for n games (more than 10 per run); blinds rotate and increase every n games (e.g., after certain rounds); big/small blinds are posted pre-flop.
- Goal: Maximize delta money (ending chips minus starting chips); if a player runs out of chips, they are eliminated from that table; no rebuys.
- Each hand has 4 betting rounds: Pre-flop (after hole cards and blinds), Flop (3 community cards), Turn (1 community card), River (1 community card).
- Actions: Fold, Check, Call, Raise (any amount up to stack, no limit), All-in.
- Hand rankings: Royal flush > Straight flush > Four of a kind > Full house > Flush > Straight > Three of a kind > Two pair > One pair > High card.
- Showdown: If multiple players remain after river betting, best 5-card hand (using any combination of 2 hole cards + 5 community cards) wins the pot; side pots form for all-ins with eligible players.
- Technical Limits: 30 seconds max per move (timeout causes automatic fold); 100MB max memory usage; any error/exception causes automatic fold; all bots are given the same compute limits.

Your task: Implement winning bot in player.py by subclassing Bot as in the template below and follow the above game rules.

Bot Design and Competition Rules:

1. Your bot must subclass Bot as SimplePlayer, implementing all required methods exactly as in the template. Preserve the class name SimplePlayer for compatibility with the game server. The template for the class is as
**SimplePlayer Template:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from bot import Bot
from type.poker_action import PokerAction
from type.round_state import RoundStateClient

class SimplePlayer(Bot):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        # TODO implement this

    def on_start(self, starting_chips: int, player_hands: List[str], blind_amount: int, big_blind_player_id: int, small_blind_player_id: int, all_players: List[int]):
        # TODO implement this

    def on_round_start(self, round_state: RoundStateClient, remaining_chips: int):
        # TODO implement this

    def get_action(self, round_state: RoundStateClient, remaining_chips: int) -> Tuple[PokerAction, int]:
        """ Returns the action for the player. """
        # TODO implement this

    def on_end_round(self, round_state: RoundStateClient, remaining_chips: int):
        """ Called at the end of the round. """
        # TODO implement this

    def on_end_game(self, round_state: RoundStateClient, player_score: float, all_scores: dict, active_players_hands: dict):
        # TODO implement this
```
2. DO NOT rename or remove any predefined methods (on_start, on_round_start, get_action, on_end_round, on_end_game), and do not change their signatures.
3. You may add helper functions and instance variables for strategy or tracking.
4. Your bot should be able to abide by no limit texas hold'em rules and handle side pots, all-ins, blind increases, multi-way pots, and be error-free (no exceptions).
5. For each action, always return valid actions:
    - For RAISE: the amount raise combine with your current bet must be larger than the the current raise.
    - For CALL: You don't need to specify the amount you call, it default to match exactly the amount needed to call (current_bet - your bet).
    - For CHECK: You can't check if round's current bet is larger than 0. Resort to other action (eg CALL, RAISE, ALL_IN).
    - For ALL_IN: You don't need to specify the amount you all in, it will default to all your current money.
    - **INVALID ACTION WILL MAKE YOU LOSE MONEY (automatic result in fold if the condition is not match for each action), so logic must always check bounds and edge cases**.
6. If you use any external libraries, they must be listed in requirements.txt (pure Python only).
7. Implement your bot with SimplePlayer. See full RoundStateClient, PokerAction, and PokerRound definitions below.
8. Your bot should maximize delta money (ending chips minus starting chips). Positive mean gaining money, the more money you gain the better.
9. There might will be data on previous run (error and game score) if this is not the first time you implement. If there is error, fix it so your bot can run. Try to improve your bot from previous round.
10. If there are no usage of external requirements, the text secion for requirement must be empty. DO NOT PUT ANYTHING ELSE. If you want to use any external library, you must put it in that text block
11. Your response must consist ONLY of two files: the complete player.py (as a Python code block) implementing the bot with all template elements preserved plus your improvements, and requirements.txt (as a text block) listing any dependencies (pure Python only, e.g., numpy if needed for calculations). Do not include any other text, explanations, or outputs. See example response below:
Example response:
```python
<Your python code>
```

```text
numpy
matplotlib
<any external library you want to use, put it here>
...
```
12. Your implementation MUST BE IN FULL not putting stub method or guideline. Everything in SimplePlayer must be ready to the detail and ready to run.
13. When you do division, make sure to make it prone to error divide by zero by adding some small delta.
14. The pool of submitted bots, including your bot, will be organized into 6-handed poker tables where every possible combination of 6 bots forms a separate table. Each table will play exactly 1,000 hands, with chip stacks carrying over between hands within the same table. 
15. At the end of each table, delta money is calculated for each bot using the formula: final chip count minus 10,000 (initial chip amount). Your bot's total tournament score is determined by summing its delta money across all tables it participates in. The bot with the highest cumulative delta money across all tables wins the tournament.
16. Your bot will undergo iterative testing across 5 rounds, where each round involves playing 10 hands of heads-up poker against a house bot. After each round, you will receive either the complete game log showing performance results or any compilation/simulation errors that occurred while attempting to run your bot. Use this feedback to refine your implementation in subsequent iterations.

Please fix these specific errors in your implementation.

IMPROVEMENT INSTRUCTIONS:
1. You are on iteration 2 - build upon the previous code
2. Analyze the errors and game performance data above
3. Fix any syntax, import, or runtime errors from the previous iteration
4. Improve the poker strategy based on game results
5. Ensure the code follows the exact template requirements
6. Return the improved implementation in the same format (Python code block + requirements.txt block)

Focus on making the bot more competitive and error-free. You can see exactly what was wrong with the previous version and should fix those specific issues.

        "refusal": null,
        "reasoning": "**Examining Bot's Failure**\n\nI'm carefully reviewing the bot's log files, searching for clues. Initial analysis reveals repeated \"Invalid action\" errors, specifically regarding raise amounts. It seems the bot isn't adhering to the minimum raise requirements. I'll need to pinpoint when the bot is making these illegal raise attempts and adjust the logic to enforce the rules. The first step is debugging the `RAISE` function!\n\n\n**Isolating The Root Cause**\n\nI'm delving deeper into the bot's decision-making process before the invalid raise. The log suggests the bot, in Game #5, incorrectly chose to raise when it should have either checked or raised a valid amount. I'm now tracing the conditions that led to this error, specifically examining how the bot assesses the board state and player actions before deciding to raise 0. The next step is to examine the hand evaluation code.\n\n\n**Diagnosing The Flaws**\n\nI'm analyzing the bot's early game performance. The log files clearly show a pattern of immediate folds in the face of pre-flop raises, followed by the \"RAISE 0\" error post-flop when the bot has the initiative. This points to a fundamental misunderstanding of betting mechanics. I'm now focused on the `get_action` method, pinpointing the code sections responsible for these decisions. I suspect it needs a complete overhaul.\n\n\n**Crafting a Strategy**\n\nI'm now focused on developing a robust pre-flop strategy. I've outlined hand strength categories, and position-based decisions. Premium hands will always raise, while strong hands will be handled situationally. Playable hands will be considered cautiously based on the current pot. I'm gearing up to write code for the hand evaluation.\n\n\n**Implementing Hand Strength**\n\nI'm now focused on hand evaluation; specifically, I need a function to calculate hand strength post-flop. I'm researching existing hand ranking algorithms to accurately compare hands. The function needs to consider the community cards and my hole cards to determine the best possible five-card hand. Afterwards, I'll start building the pre-flop strategy.\n\n\n**Designing The Hand Evaluator**\n\nI'm establishing the core functions for the hand evaluator. I'm planning a function to parse card strings to a numerical format, mapping ranks to numerical values for easier comparison. Next I plan to create a helper function to determine the best hand using `itertools.combinations`. The foundation for accurate hand strength calculation is now in place.\n\n\n**Developing the Hand Evaluator**\n\nI'm now diving deep into the hand evaluator's design. My primary focus is to create a robust function to accurately assess hand strength, considering all poker hand rankings. I've outlined functions for parsing card strings, and I'm researching efficient methods for comparing hands. The combination of these elements will form the core of the bot's strategy. I am now focused on implementing the basic functions.\n\n\n**Defining Rank Evaluation**\n\nI'm now outlining the exact structure of the hand evaluation. This includes determining a numerical representation for each hand rank (royal flush, straight flush, etc.) and implementing tie-breaking. My focus is now on the core `_evaluate_hand` function. I must first complete the foundational components for hand ranking before I can continue to the pre-flop logic.\n\n\n**Implementing `get_action`**\n\nI'm currently working on the `get_action` method, the heart of the bot's decision-making. I've integrated the parsing of card strings, hand evaluation functions. I'm now tackling the pre-flop and post-flop logic, incorporating the hand strength assessments, and implementing the betting strategy. I'm focused on ensuring all raise amounts are validated, so I don't get an \"Invalid action\" again!\n\n\n**Building Core Functions**\n\nI'm now focused on the core card parsing and hand evaluation functions. Parsing cards is straightforward, converting string representations into numerical values. The hand evaluator, however, demands meticulous attention to detail. My focus has shifted to implementing the `_evaluate_hand` function to assess all poker hand rankings.\n\n\n**Constructing the Evaluator**\n\nI'm currently finalizing the card parsing function, which is essential for translating card strings into a usable format for comparison. I am now starting on the hand evaluator's core, including functions to handle hand ranking. I'm focusing on generating combinations of hands for comparison, and creating the framework for evaluating all poker hand rankings.\n\n\n**Building Evaluator Logic**\n\nI'm now crafting the core `_evaluate_hand` function. It will iterate through the possible 5-card combinations and determine the highest-ranking hand. I'm starting to build functions to check the different hand types, beginning with `_check_straight_flush`. Next will be functions for `_check_four_of_a_kind` and `_check_full_house`.\n\n\n**Constructing the Framework**\n\nI'm now focusing on the foundation of the hand evaluation process. I am creating the skeleton for the `_evaluate_hand` function that will handle all possible poker hand rankings. My current goal is to build the basic structure for the function and prepare the groundwork for comparing the values.\n\n\n**Implementing Hand Ranking**\n\nI'm now focusing on integrating the various hand ranking functions within `_evaluate_hand`. Specifically, I'll need to assemble all the ranking checks into a unified structure. The priority is ensuring accurate comparison of hands and assigning the correct hand ranks. The next step is implementing the flush.\n\n\n**Finalizing The Framework**\n\nI'm now building the core evaluation functions, starting with the `_evaluate_hand` framework. I am mapping the card strings to numerical values, and preparing for the iteration across all possible five-card combinations. I will then implement the rank determination.\n\n\n**Refining the Strategy**\n\nI'm now focusing on refining the core strategy. I'm incorporating a pre-flop hand strength matrix and more nuanced post-flop actions based on hand ranks and the presence of draws, as well as the number of opponents. I'm preparing to test it and ensure all action amounts are valid. The goal is to create a robust bot.\n\n\n**Coding Hand Evaluation**\n\nI'm now focused on the core `_parse_cards` function to create a numerical representation of the cards, followed by building out the hand evaluation logic. My goal is to streamline comparisons. I will then build the hand ranking functions.\n\n\n**Finalizing Implementation**\n\nI'm now integrating all the code modules to the testing environment. I'm confirming that the bot's logic handles all game states. I'm focused on ensuring the bot adheres to the betting constraints and doesn't make any invalid actions. This bot will be able to perform, and *not* automatically fold.\n\n\n**Implementing Action Validation**\n\nI'm now integrating the game logic to handle hand evaluation and action selection. Specifically, I'm focused on ensuring that all actions, including raises and calls, adhere to the game's constraints. This includes checking minimum and maximum raise amounts and other related rules. My current focus is on debugging the `get_action` function and its interactions with the hand rankings.\n\n\n**Coding Bot Logic**\n\nI'm now actively working on the complete bot implementation, starting with the hand evaluation and pre-flop strategy. The focus is on building a functional player that can compete. I'm now building all helper functions.\n\n\n**Integrating Evaluation & Action**\n\nI'm now focused on integrating the hand evaluator with the betting logic and strategy, ensuring the bot makes reasonable choices based on hand strength and betting context. I have verified the hand evaluator is functioning correctly and am now focused on thoroughly testing the `get_action` and ensuring the bot responds appropriately. The bot is ready to be stress-tested.\n\n\n**Testing Action Implementation**\n\nI'm now focused on creating the basic functions, and checking for errors. I'm making sure the bot's actions are validated. I will now create test cases to verify functionality. The code should be working, but I need to ensure the \"Invalid action\" is fixed.\n\n\n**Integrating All Modules**\n\nI'm now putting everything together: The parsing, pre-flop strategy, hand evaluator, and post-flop decision-making. The goal is a cohesive bot, and I'm ensuring all components function as designed. I'm focusing on error handling and the modularity of the code.\n\n\n**Finalizing Implementation**\n\nI'm putting the pieces together: `_parse_cards`, `_get_preflop_strength`, `_evaluate_7_cards`, and `_check_draws`, along with `get_action`'s logic. I'm ensuring each module functions correctly and fits the overall design, including pre-flop strategies and post-flop bet sizing. The bot needs to run now!\n\n\n**Finalizing the Code**\n\nI'm now preparing the complete, runnable bot. I've checked over all helper functions, `_get_preflop_strength`, the card parser, and the hand evaluator's functions to ensure the logic is correct. I'm implementing the final test cases, and checking for logic errors in `get_action`, specifically the raise amount validation. The code is now ready.\n\n\n**Coding Initial Functions**\n\nI'm now focusing on the core of the project, starting with the implementation of `_parse_cards` to transform string representations of cards into usable numerical values. After that, I'm building `_evaluate_5_cards` to accurately score hands, setting up the foundational hand evaluation. I must ensure all the functions can be tested.\n\n\n**Building & Integrating**\n\nI'm now integrating the final hand evaluation with the improved betting strategy. All code is written, and I'm stress-testing to ensure the \"Invalid action\" errors are gone. I'm focused on the `get_action` function. I'm preparing for the final submissions.\n\n\n**Refining Implementation**\n\nI'm now focused on optimizing the core functions, specifically the card parsing and hand evaluator.

          {
            "type": "reasoning.text",
            "text": "**Examining Bot's Failure**\n\nI'm carefully reviewing the bot's log files, searching for clues. Initial analysis reveals repeated \"Invalid action\" errors, specifically regarding raise amounts. It seems the bot isn't adhering to the minimum raise requirements. I'll need to pinpoint when the bot is making these illegal raise attempts and adjust the logic to enforce the rules. The first step is debugging the `RAISE` function!\n\n\n**Isolating The Root Cause**\n\nI'm delving deeper into the bot's decision-making process before the invalid raise. The log suggests the bot, in Game #5, incorrectly chose to raise when it should have either checked or raised a valid amount. I'm now tracing the conditions that led to this error, specifically examining how the bot assesses the board state and player actions before deciding to raise 0. The next step is to examine the hand evaluation code.\n\n\n**Diagnosing The Flaws**\n\nI'm analyzing the bot's early game performance. The log files clearly show a pattern of immediate folds in the face of pre-flop raises, followed by the \"RAISE 0\" error post-flop when the bot has the initiative. This points to a fundamental misunderstanding of betting mechanics. I'm now focused on the `get_action` method, pinpointing the code sections responsible for these decisions. I suspect it needs a complete overhaul.\n\n\n**Crafting a Strategy**\n\nI'm now focused on developing a robust pre-flop strategy. I've outlined hand strength categories, and position-based decisions. Premium hands will always raise, while strong hands will be handled situationally. Playable hands will be considered cautiously based on the current pot. I'm gearing up to write code for the hand evaluation.\n\n\n**Implementing Hand Strength**\n\nI'm now focused on hand evaluation; specifically, I need a function to calculate hand strength post-flop. I'm researching existing hand ranking algorithms to accurately compare hands. The function needs to consider the community cards and my hole cards to determine the best possible five-card hand. Afterwards, I'll start building the pre-flop strategy.\n\n\n**Designing The Hand Evaluator**\n\nI'm establishing the core functions for the hand evaluator. I'm planning a function to parse card strings to a numerical format, mapping ranks to numerical values for easier comparison. Next I plan to create a helper function to determine the best hand using `itertools.combinations`. The foundation for accurate hand strength calculation is now in place.\n\n\n**Developing the Hand Evaluator**\n\nI'm now diving deep into the hand evaluator's design. My primary focus is to create a robust function to accurately assess hand strength, considering all poker hand rankings. I've outlined functions for parsing card strings, and I'm researching efficient methods for comparing hands. The combination of these elements will form the core of the bot's strategy. I am now focused on implementing the basic functions.\n\n\n**Defining Rank Evaluation**\n\nI'm now outlining the exact structure of the hand evaluation. This includes determining a numerical representation for each hand rank (royal flush, straight flush, etc.) and implementing tie-breaking. My focus is now on the core `_evaluate_hand` function. I must first complete the foundational components for hand ranking before I can continue to the pre-flop logic.\n\n\n**Implementing `get_action`**\n\nI'm currently working on the `get_action` method, the heart of the bot's decision-making. I've integrated the parsing of card strings, hand evaluation functions. I'm now tackling the pre-flop and post-flop logic, incorporating the hand strength assessments, and implementing the betting strategy. I'm focused on ensuring all raise amounts are validated, so I don't get an \"Invalid action\" again!\n\n\n**Building Core Functions**\n\nI'm now focused on the core card parsing and hand evaluation functions. Parsing cards is straightforward, converting string representations into numerical values. The hand evaluator, however, demands meticulous attention to detail. My focus has shifted to implementing the `_evaluate_hand` function to assess all poker hand rankings.\n\n\n**Constructing the Evaluator**\n\nI'm currently finalizing the card parsing function, which is essential for translating card strings into a usable format for comparison. I am now starting on the hand evaluator's core, including functions to handle hand ranking. I'm focusing on generating combinations of hands for comparison, and creating the framework for evaluating all poker hand rankings.\n\n\n**Building Evaluator Logic**\n\nI'm now crafting the core `_evaluate_hand` function. It will iterate through the possible 5-card combinations and determine the highest-ranking hand. I'm starting to build functions to check the different hand types, beginning with `_check_straight_flush`. Next will be functions for `_check_four_of_a_kind` and `_check_full_house`.\n\n\n**Constructing the Framework**\n\nI'm now focusing on the foundation of the hand evaluation process. I am creating the skeleton for the `_evaluate_hand` function that will handle all possible poker hand rankings. My current goal is to build the basic structure for the function and prepare the groundwork for comparing the values.\n\n\n**Implementing Hand Ranking**\n\nI'm now focusing on integrating the various hand ranking functions within `_evaluate_hand`. Specifically, I'll need to assemble all the ranking checks into a unified structure. The priority is ensuring accurate comparison of hands and assigning the correct hand ranks. The next step is implementing the flush.\n\n\n**Finalizing The Framework**\n\nI'm now building the core evaluation functions, starting with the `_evaluate_hand` framework. I am mapping the card strings to numerical values, and preparing for the iteration across all possible five-card combinations. I will then implement the rank determination.\n\n\n**Refining the Strategy**\n\nI'm now focusing on refining the core strategy. I'm incorporating a pre-flop hand strength matrix and more nuanced post-flop actions based on hand ranks and the presence of draws, as well as the number of opponents. I'm preparing to test it and ensure all action amounts are valid. The goal is to create a robust bot.\n\n\n**Coding Hand Evaluation**\n\nI'm now focused on the core `_parse_cards` function to create a numerical representation of the cards, followed by building out the hand evaluation logic. My goal is to streamline comparisons. I will then build the hand ranking functions.\n\n\n**Finalizing Implementation**\n\nI'm now integrating all the code modules to the testing environment. I'm confirming that the bot's logic handles all game states. I'm focused on ensuring the bot adheres to the betting constraints and doesn't make any invalid actions. This bot will be able to perform, and *not* automatically fold.\n\n\n**Implementing Action Validation**\n\nI'm now integrating the game logic to handle hand evaluation and action selection. Specifically, I'm focused on ensuring that all actions, including raises and calls, adhere to the game's constraints. This includes checking minimum and maximum raise amounts and other related rules. My current focus is on debugging the `get_action` function and its interactions with the hand rankings.\n\n\n**Coding Bot Logic**\n\nI'm now actively working on the complete bot implementation, starting with the hand evaluation and pre-flop strategy. The focus is on building a functional player that can compete. I'm now building all helper functions.\n\n\n**Integrating Evaluation & Action**\n\nI'm now focused on integrating the hand evaluator with the betting logic and strategy, ensuring the bot makes reasonable choices based on hand strength and betting context. I have verified the hand evaluator is functioning correctly and am now focused on thoroughly testing the `get_action` and ensuring the bot responds appropriately. The bot is ready to be stress-tested.\n\n\n**Testing Action Implementation**\n\nI'm now focused on creating the basic functions, and checking for errors. I'm making sure the bot's actions are validated. I will now create test cases to verify functionality. The code should be working, but I need to ensure the \"Invalid action\" is fixed.\n\n\n**Integrating All Modules**\n\nI'm now putting everything together: The parsing, pre-flop strategy, hand evaluator, and post-flop decision-making. The goal is a cohesive bot, and I'm ensuring all components function as designed. I'm focusing on error handling and the modularity of the code.\n\n\n**Finalizing Implementation**\n\nI'm putting the pieces together: `_parse_cards`, `_get_preflop_strength`, `_evaluate_7_cards`, and `_check_draws`, along with `get_action`'s logic. I'm ensuring each module functions correctly and fits the overall design, including pre-flop strategies and post-flop bet sizing. The bot needs to run now!\n\n\n**Finalizing the Code**\n\nI'm now preparing the complete, runnable bot. I've checked over all helper functions, `_get_preflop_strength`, the card parser, and the hand evaluator's functions to ensure the logic is correct. I'm implementing the final test cases, and checking for logic errors in `get_action`, specifically the raise amount validation. The code is now ready.\n\n\n**Coding Initial Functions**\n\nI'm now focusing on the core of the project, starting with the implementation of `_parse_cards` to transform string representations of cards into usable numerical values. After that, I'm building `_evaluate_5_cards` to accurately score hands, setting up the foundational hand evaluation. I must ensure all the functions can be tested.\n\n\n**Building & Integrating**\n\nI'm now integrating the final hand evaluation with the improved betting strategy. All code is written, and I'm stress-testing to ensure the \"Invalid action\" errors are gone. I'm focused on the `get_action` function. I'm preparing for the final submissions.\n\n\n**Refining Implementation**\n\nI'm now focused on optimizing the core functions, specifically the card parsing and hand evaluator.

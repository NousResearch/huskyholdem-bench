PROMPT:
You are tasked with submitting a poker bot to a No-Limit Texas Hold'em poker bot competition: Husky Hold'em.

**Detailed Game Rules**
- No-Limit Texas Hold'em with 2-10 players (often 6-handed tables); bots compete in heads-up or multi-player matches hosted by a central game server.
- Players start with $10,000 chips at the simulation start; simulations run for n games (more than 10 per run); blinds rotate and increase every n games (e.g., after certain rounds); big/small blinds are posted pre-flop.
- Goal: Maximize delta money (ending chips minus starting chips); if a player runs out of chips, they are eliminated from that table; no rebuys.
- Each hand has 4 betting rounds: Pre-flop (after hole cards and blinds), Flop (3 community cards), Turn (1 community card), River (1 community card).
- Actions: Fold, Check, Call, Raise (any amount up to stack, no limit), All-in.
- Hand rankings: Royal flush > Straight flush > Four of a kind > Full house > Flush > Straight > Three of a kind > Two pair > One pair > High card.
- Showdown: If multiple players remain after river betting, best 5-card hand (using any combination of 2 hole cards + 5 community cards) wins the pot; side pots form for all-ins with eligible players.
- Technical Limits: 30 seconds max per move (timeout causes automatic fold); 100MB max memory usage; any error/exception causes automatic fold; all bots are given the same compute limits.

Your task: Implement winning bot in player.py by subclassing Bot as in the template below and follow the above game rules.

Bot Design and Competition Rules:

1. Your bot must subclass Bot as SimplePlayer, implementing all required methods exactly as in the template. Preserve the class name SimplePlayer for compatibility with the game server. The template for the class is as
**SimplePlayer Template:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from bot import Bot
from type.poker_action import PokerAction
from type.round_state import RoundStateClient

class SimplePlayer(Bot):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        # TODO implement this

    def on_start(self, starting_chips: int, player_hands: List[str], blind_amount: int, big_blind_player_id: int, small_blind_player_id: int, all_players: List[int]):
        # TODO implement this

    def on_round_start(self, round_state: RoundStateClient, remaining_chips: int):
        # TODO implement this

    def get_action(self, round_state: RoundStateClient, remaining_chips: int) -> Tuple[PokerAction, int]:
        """ Returns the action for the player. """
        # TODO implement this

    def on_end_round(self, round_state: RoundStateClient, remaining_chips: int):
        """ Called at the end of the round. """
        # TODO implement this

    def on_end_game(self, round_state: RoundStateClient, player_score: float, all_scores: dict, active_players_hands: dict):
        # TODO implement this
```
2. DO NOT rename or remove any predefined methods (on_start, on_round_start, get_action, on_end_round, on_end_game), and do not change their signatures.
3. You may add helper functions and instance variables for strategy or tracking.
4. Your bot should be able to abide by no limit texas hold'em rules and handle side pots, all-ins, blind increases, multi-way pots, and be error-free (no exceptions).
5. For each action, always return valid actions:
    - For RAISE: the amount raise combine with your current bet must be larger than the the current raise.
    - For CALL: You don't need to specify the amount you call, it default to match exactly the amount needed to call (current_bet - your bet).
    - For CHECK: You can't check if round's current bet is larger than 0. Resort to other action (eg CALL, RAISE, ALL_IN).
    - For ALL_IN: You don't need to specify the amount you all in, it will default to all your current money.
    - **INVALID ACTION WILL MAKE YOU LOSE MONEY (automatic result in fold if the condition is not match for each action), so logic must always check bounds and edge cases**.
6. If you use any external libraries, they must be listed in requirements.txt (pure Python only).
7. Implement your bot with SimplePlayer. See full RoundStateClient, PokerAction, and PokerRound definitions below.
8. Your bot should maximize delta money (ending chips minus starting chips). Positive mean gaining money, the more money you gain the better.
9. There might will be data on previous run (error and game score) if this is not the first time you implement. If there is error, fix it so your bot can run. Try to improve your bot from previous round.
10. If there are no usage of external requirements, the text secion for requirement must be empty. DO NOT PUT ANYTHING ELSE. If you want to use any external library, you must put it in that text block
11. Your response must consist ONLY of two files: the complete player.py (as a Python code block) implementing the bot with all template elements preserved plus your improvements, and requirements.txt (as a text block) listing any dependencies (pure Python only, e.g., numpy if needed for calculations). Do not include any other text, explanations, or outputs. See example response below:
Example response:
```python
<Your python code>
```

```text
numpy
matplotlib
<any external library you want to use, put it here>
...
```
12. Your implementation MUST BE IN FULL not putting stub method or guideline. Everything in SimplePlayer must be ready to the detail and ready to run.
13. When you do division, make sure to make it prone to error divide by zero by adding some small delta.
14. The pool of submitted bots, including your bot, will be organized into 6-handed poker tables where every possible combination of 6 bots forms a separate table. Each table will play exactly 1,000 hands, with chip stacks carrying over between hands within the same table. 
15. At the end of each table, delta money is calculated for each bot using the formula: final chip count minus 10,000 (initial chip amount). Your bot's total tournament score is determined by summing its delta money across all tables it participates in. The bot with the highest cumulative delta money across all tables wins the tournament.
16. Your bot will undergo iterative testing across 5 rounds, where each round involves playing 10 hands of heads-up poker against a house bot. After each round, you will receive either the complete game log showing performance results or any compilation/simulation errors that occurred while attempting to run your bot. Use this feedback to refine your implementation in subsequent iterations.

        "reasoning": "We are going to implement a poker bot that uses a simple strategy based on hand strength and position.\n The bot will evaluate its hole cards and the community cards to decide on an action.\n We will use a hand strength evaluation that considers the current hand and the potential.\n Since we cannot use external libraries unless specified, we will implement a basic hand evaluator.\n However, note that the problem allows external libraries if listed in requirements.txt. We will try to avoid for simplicity.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We'll create a helper function to evaluate the hand strength (pre-flop, flop, turn, river).\n 2. We'll use a simple strategy: \n    - Pre-flop: play tight-aggressive with a threshold for starting hands.\n    - Post-flop: use the hand strength to decide.\n\n 3. We'll track the current round and adjust for position (if we are in late position, we can play more hands).\n\n 4. We'll consider the pot odds and the current bet when deciding to call or raise.\n\n 5. We'll manage the stack size and avoid going all-in unless we have a very strong hand.\n\n However, note: We have to be cautious of the technical limits (30 seconds, 100MB). Our hand evaluator must be efficient.\n\n Since we are not allowed to use external libraries without listing, and we are only allowed pure Python, we can use a precomputed table for hand strengths?\n But we are going to implement a simple one that works for 5-7 cards.\n\n But note: The hand must be evaluated from 7 cards (2 hole + 5 community). We need to pick the best 5-card hand.\n\n We can use the method of comparing hand rankings by:\n   - Checking for flush, straight, then counts.\n\n However, writing a full hand evaluator might be time-consuming and error-prone. There are known algorithms (like the one by Kevin L. Suffern) but we need a fast one.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a lookup table for two-card combinations (pre-flop) and then for post-flop we can use a simpler method.\n\n Given the constraints, we will do:\n\n Pre-flop:\n   - Assign a starting hand strength (using a table of hand groups). We can use the Sklansky-Chubukov rankings? Or a simple table.\n\n Post-flop:\n   - We'll evaluate the current hand by considering all 5-card combinations from the 7 (or 5, or 6) cards? That's 21 combinations for 7 cards -> acceptable.\n\n Steps for hand evaluation for 5-7 cards:\n   - We'll generate all combinations of 5 cards from the available cards (if 7 cards, then 21 combinations) and evaluate each 5-card hand.\n\n How to evaluate a 5-card hand?\n   - We can assign a numeric score: \n        First, categorize the hand (flush, straight, etc.) and then by the high card, then kicker, etc.\n\n   - We'll create a function `evaluate_hand(hand: List[str]) -> (hand_rank: int, tie_breaker: list)`\n\n   - Hand_rank: \n        0: high card\n        1: one pair\n        2: two pair\n        3: three of a kind\n        4: straight\n        5: flush\n        6: full house\n        7: four of a kind\n        8: straight flush\n\n   - Tie_breaker: a list of the high cards and kickers in descending order.\n\n 6. We'll then use the hand strength to determine the probability of winning? Or we can use a simple threshold.\n\n However, note: We don't know the opponent hands. We can only assume worse hands.\n\n Given the complexity and time, we will use a simpler approach:\n\n   Pre-flop:\n     We'll use a precomputed table of hole card strengths (from 0 to 1) for all 169 starting hands (suited and off-suit).\n\n   Post-flop:\n     We'll compute the current hand strength (our best hand from the 5-7 cards) and then compare it to the best possible hand (the nuts) in the current community cards? \n     But we don't know opponent hands. \n\n     Alternatively, we can compute the relative strength (current hand vs the best hand that can be made with the community cards). \n\n     We can do:\n        current_best = our hand strength\n        nuts = the best hand that can be made from the community cards and any two hole cards? Actually, we don't know the hole cards, but we can compute the best hand using the community cards and any two imaginary cards? \n\n     Actually, we can compute the best hand from the community cards alone? But that would be 5 cards. We can compute the best possible hand (the nuts) by considering all two-card combinations that would make the best hand with the community cards? That's 45 choose 2? -> too expensive.\n\n     Alternatively, we can compute the best hand that can be made from the 5 community cards? That's just the 5 cards. Then we can see how our hand compares? But that doesn't account for the fact that we have two hole cards.\n\n     We can compute: \n        current_hand = our best hand (from 5-7 cards)\n        best_possible = the best hand that can be made from the community cards and any two hole cards? -> but we don't know, so we skip?\n\n     Instead, we can use the current hand strength and then adjust by the board texture (if there are flush draws, straight draws, etc.)\n\n 7. We'll use a simple decision matrix:\n\n    Let hand_strength = (pre-computed pre-flop strength for hole cards) for pre-flop.\n    For post-flop, we compute the hand rank and then normalize it to [0,1] (by mapping the hand rank: 0->0, 1->0.1, ... 8->1.0) and then add the kickers as fractions? \n\n    Actually, we can compute the hand strength as the win probability against a random hand? But that requires simulation.\n\n    Given time, we will use a simpler approach:\n\n        Pre-flop: \n          - We have a group for each starting hand (using a table). We'll use the Sklansky-Karlsson groups? Or a simple fixed table.\n\n        Pre-flop groups (simplified):\n          Group 1: AA, KK\n          Group 2: AKs, AQs, JJ, TT\n          Group 3: AK, AJs, KQs, 99, 88\n          ... etc.\n\n        We assign a value to each group and then combine with position.\n\n    For post-flop, we'll compute the hand rank and then use:\n\n        strength = hand_rank_value + 0.01 * (high card value) ... but that is not enough.\n\n    Instead, we can use a lookup table for the current hand? But we don't have one.\n\n 8. We decide to use a very simple hand evaluator for 5 cards and then use that to compute the strength of our 7-card hand by taking the best 5-card hand.\n\n Implementation of hand evaluator for 5 cards:\n\n   Steps:\n     - Check for flush: all same suit? -> if yes, then check for straight, then royal flush, straight flush, then for straight flush.\n     - Check for straight: sorted ranks? and consecutive? Note: A can be high or low.\n\n     We'll map the card ranks to numbers: \n        '2':2, '3':3, ... '10':10, 'J':11, 'Q':12, 'K':13, 'A':14\n\n     Then check for straight: sort the numbers, and then check if consecutive or if [2,3,4,5,14] (wheel).\n\n     - Then check for multiples: count the frequency of each rank.\n\n   We'll create a function `hand_rank(hand)` that returns (rank, [high card, ... tie breakers]).\n\n   We'll use:\n        (8, [14]) for royal flush? actually straight flush is 8 regardless, and then the high card.\n        (7, [four of a kind rank, kicker]) for four of a kind? \n        (6, [three of a kind rank, pair rank]) for full house? \n        (5, [high card, ...]) for flush? \n        (4, [high card, ...]) for straight? \n        (3, [three of a kind rank, kickers]) for three of a kind? \n        (2, [high pair, low pair, kicker]) for two pair? \n        (1, [pair rank, kickers]) for one pair? \n        (0, [kickers]) for high card.\n\n   Then we can compare two hands by comparing the rank, then the tie breakers.\n\n 9. But note: we are in a time-botted environment. We must be efficient. For 7 cards, we have 21 combinations -> 21*5 = 105 cards to evaluate? That should be acceptable.\n\n 10. We'll implement the hand evaluator for 5 cards and then for 7 cards we'll generate all combinations and pick the best.\n\n 11. Pre-flop: we'll use a precomputed table for the 169 starting hands. We'll use the table from: \n        https://www.omnicalculator.com/sports/poker-odds?c=USD&v=community:deck!52&ranks:pair!1;single!1;single!1;suits:suited!1;unsuited!0\n\n     Actually, we can use a simple table that maps a hand string (like \"AKo\", \"AJs\") to a strength value.\n\n     We'll create a dictionary for the strength of each starting hand (both suited and offsuit).\n\n     We'll use the following groups (with strength from 0 to 1) for pre-flop:\n\n        Group 1: AA -> 1.0\n        Group 2: KK, AKs -> 0.9\n        Group 3: QQ, AK, JJ -> 0.8\n        Group 4: AQs, TT, AJs, KQs -> 0.7\n        Group 5: AQ, 99, KJs, QJs, JTs -> 0.6\n        Group 6: 88, ATs, KTs, QTs, J9s, T9s -> 0.5\n        ... and so on.\n\n     We don't have a complete table, but we can assign based on common knowledge.\n\n 12. Strategy:\n\n    Pre-flop:\n        - If we are in early position: only play group 1 to 3.\n        - Middle position: group 1 to 4.\n        - Late position: group 1 to 5.\n\n        But note: we don't know our position relative to the button? We have the current player list and the blinds.\n\n        How to determine position?\n            We know the small blind and big blind. The positions are: small blind (SB), big blind (BB), then UTG, MP, LP, button? \n            Actually, we are given the blinds and the current players. We can compute the position by:\n\n                positions = sorted([(player_bets[player_id] if player_id in player_bets else 0) for ... ])  -> not directly.\n\n            Alternatively, we can note the order of the current players? The `current_player` list is the list of player IDs in the current order? \n\n            Actually, the `RoundStateClient` has `current_player: List[int]` which is the list of players who are still in the hand? And the order is the order of play?\n\n            We can determine our position by:\n\n                num_players = len(round_state.current_player)\n                our_index = round_state.current_player.index(self.id)\n\n                position_index = our_index  # 0 is the first to act (early), num_players-1 is the last to act (late)\n\n            We can define:\n                early: position_index <= 1 (if num_players>=3) and for heads-up, we can consider differently.\n\n        We'll define:\n\n            early: position_index < ceil(num_players / 3)\n            middle: position_index < 2 * ceil(num_players / 3) and >= ceil(num_players / 3)\n            late: position_index >= 2 * ceil(num_players / 3)\n\n        But note: in heads-up, the small blind is the button and acts first pre-flop? Actually, in heads-up the small blind is the dealer and acts first pre-flop, then the big blind.\n\n        We'll keep it simple: if num_players<=3, then we are in early, middle, late? \n\n        Actually, we can just use the index relative to the total.\n\n        We'll use:\n\n            position_strength = our_index / (num_players - 1)   # 0 for first, 1 for last -> so late position has higher strength.\n\n        Then we can adjust the threshold.\n\n    Pre-flop action:\n\n        Let hand_strength = get_preflop_strength(hole_cards)   # returns a value between 0 and 1.\n\n        Then we set a threshold for calling, raising, and folding.\n\n        We'll have:\n\n            fold_threshold = 0.3  # if our hand strength is below this, fold.\n            call_threshold = 0.5   # if above, at least call.\n            raise_threshold = 0.7   # if above, we can raise.\n\n        But adjust by position:\n\n            We can lower the threshold in late position.\n\n            adjusted_fold_threshold = fold_threshold * (1 - 0.1 * position_strength)\n            adjusted_call_threshold = call_threshold * (1 - 0.1 * position_strength)\n            adjusted_raise_threshold = raise_threshold * (1 - 0.1 * position_strength)\n\n        Then:\n\n            if hand_strength < adjusted_fold_threshold:\n                return (PokerAction.FOLD, 0)   # FOLD doesn't take amount? But the template requires an int. We return 0.\n\n            elif hand_strength < adjusted_call_threshold:\n                # We are in between: if no one has raised, we can check if possible? But pre-flop there is blinds.\n\n                # If we can check (i.e., we are the big blind and no raise) then check.\n                # But note: pre-flop, we have to at least call the big blind? unless we are the big blind and no raise, then we can check.\n\n                # How to check: if the current bet is 0 and we are the big blind?

We map that to a value between 0 and 1.\n\n        Then we use similar thresholds, but we also consider the pot odds.\n\n        How to compute pot odds?\n\n            pot_odds = to_call / (round_state.pot + to_call)   # the fraction we need to win to break even.\n\n        We can estimate our winning probability: hand_strength normalized? But note: our hand strength is absolute against the board? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use our hand rank: \n            win_prob = (hand_rank_value) / 8.0   # this is a rough estimate.\n\n        Then if win_prob > pot_odds, we can call? \n\n        But note: we might be facing multiple opponents.

We can take the community cards and then add any two hole cards? That's too expensive.\n\n            # Instead, we can compute the best hand from the community cards alone?

For example, if we have two cards that complete a straight flush that the community doesn't show.\n\n            # We don't have the whole deck to check, so we skip.\n\n            # We'll use hand_strength_value as an estimate.\n\n            if hand_strength_value > pot_odds:\n                # We have positive expected value? \n                # Then we can at least call.\n\n                # Now, if we have a very strong hand, we can raise.\n\n                if hand_strength_value >= 0.85:   # we have at least a straight or flush?\n                    # We raise: by the amount of the pot? \n                    raise_amount = round_state.pot   # we raise by the pot size? \n                    # But we must raise at least min_raise, and at most max_raise.\n                    raise_amount = min(max(raise_amount, round_state.min_raise), round_state.max_raise)\n                    return (PokerAction.RAISE, raise_amount)\n                else:\n                    if to_call == 0:\n                        return (PokerAction.CHECK, 0)\n                    else:\n                        return (PokerAction.CALL, to_call)\n            else:\n                # We don't have the pot odds? Then fold unless we can check.\n                if to_call == 0:\n                    return (PokerAction.CHECK, 0)\n                else:\n                    return (PokerAction.FOLD, 0)\n\n 13. We must also consider: \n        - If we are short stacked, we might go all-in with a good hand.\n\n        - If the opponent goes all-in, we have to decide based on pot odds.\n\n 14. We'll store the blind_amount from on_start and also the starting chips? But we don't need them for the strategy? \n\n 15. We'll implement the hand evaluator for 5 cards and then for 7 cards we'll generate all combinations and pick the best.\n\n 16. We'll create a helper function for the hand evaluator.\n\n Steps for hand evaluator for 5 cards:\n\n   Input: list of 5 strings, e.g., ['Ah', 'Ks', '3d', '4h', '5c']\n\n   Steps:\n     - Map each card to (rank, suit). Convert rank to number: \n          rank_order = {'2':2, '3':3, ..., '10':10, 'J':11, 'Q':12, 'K':13, 'A':14}\n\n     - Check for flush: if all suits are the same.\n\n     - Check for straight: \n          ranks = sorted([rank_order[card[0]] for card in hand])\n          # Check for consecutive: \n          if ranks == [2,3,4,5,14]: # wheel (Ace low)\n              high = 5\n          else:\n              # check consecutive\n              high = None\n              for i in range(4):\n                  if ranks[i+1] - ranks[i] != 1:\n                      break\n              else:\n                  high = ranks[4]\n\n          If high is not None, then straight.\n\n     - Count the frequency of each rank.\n\n        frequencies = {}\n        for r in ranks:\n            frequencies[r] = frequencies.get(r,0)+1\n\n        freq_list = sorted(frequencies.values(), reverse=True)   # [3,1,1] for three of a kind.\n\n     - Now, if flush and straight: then straight flush (or royal flush) -> hand_rank = 8, high card = high (from straight)\n\n     - Else if flush: hand_rank = 5, and then the kicker is the sorted ranks in descending order.\n\n     - Else if straight: hand_rank = 4, kicker = [high]? \n\n     - Else, check the frequency list:\n\n        if freq_list[0] == 4:\n            hand_rank = 7\n            tie_breaker = [r for r, count in frequencies.items() if count==4][0]   # the rank of the four of a kind\n            # then the kicker: the other card\n            kicker = [r for r, count in frequencies.items() if count==1][0]\n            tie_breaker = [tie_breaker, kicker]\n\n        elif freq_list[0] == 3 and freq_list[1]==2:\n            hand_rank = 6   # full house\n            three_rank = [r for r, count in frequencies.items() if count==3][0]\n            two_rank = [r for r, count in frequencies.items() if count==2][0]\n            tie_breaker = [three_rank, two_rank]\n\n        elif freq_list[0]==3:\n            hand_rank = 3   # three of a kind\n            three_rank = [r for r, count in frequencies.items() if count==3][0]\n            kickers = sorted([r for r, count in frequencies.items() if count==1], reverse=True)\n            tie_breaker = [three_rank] + kickers   # [three_rank, kicker1, kicker2]\n\n        elif freq_list[0]==2 and freq_list[1]==2:\n            hand_rank = 2   # two pair\n            pairs = sorted([r for r, count in frequencies.items() if count==2], reverse=True)\n            kicker = [r for r, count in frequencies.items() if count==1][0]\n            tie_breaker = [pairs[0], pairs[1], kicker]\n\n        elif freq_list[0]==2:\n            hand_rank = 1   # one pair\n            pair_rank = [r for r, count in frequencies.items() if count==2][0]\n            kickers = sorted([r for r, count in frequencies.items() if count==1], reverse=True)\n            tie_breaker = [pair_rank] + kickers\n\n        else:\n            hand_rank = 0   # high card\n            kicker = sorted(ranks, reverse=True)\n            tie_breaker = kicker\n\n     - Return (hand_rank, tie_breaker)\n\n 17. For 7 cards, we generate all combinations of 5 cards, evaluate each, and pick the best.\n\n     How to compare two hand evaluations? \n        First by hand_rank (higher is better), then by tie_breaker (lexicographically from first to last).\n\n     We'll create a function `best_hand(cards: List[str])` that returns (hand_rank, tie_breaker)\n\n 18. Pre-flop strength table:\n\n        We'll create a dictionary for the 169 hands.\n\n        We'll assign:\n\n            AA: 1.0\n            KK: 0.95\n            AKs: 0.92\n            AK: 0.90\n            QQ: 0.88\n            JJ: 0.85\n            AQs: 0.83\n            AQ: 0.80\n            TT: 0.78\n            AJs: 0.75\n            KQs: 0.74\n            ATs: 0.73\n            KJs: 0.72\n            QJs: 0.71\n            JTs: 0.70\n            A9s: 0.69\n            ... etc.\n\n        We can find a table online and hardcode. But for simplicity, we'll assign:\n\n            Group1: AA, KK -> 1.0, 0.95\n            Group2: AKs, QQ, AK -> 0.92, 0.88, 0.90\n            Group3: JJ, AQs, TT -> 0.85, 0.83, 0.78\n\n        We'll do:\n\n            suited_strength = {\n                'AA': 1.0, 'KK': 0.95, 'AKs': 0.92, 'AK': 0.90, \n                'QQ': 0.88, 'JJ': 0.85, 'AQs': 0.83, 'TT': 0.78,\n                'AJs': 0.75, 'KQs': 0.74, 'ATs': 0.73, 'KJs': 0.72,\n                'QTs': 0.71, 'JTs': 0.70, 'A9s': 0.69, 'KTs': 0.68,\n                'Q9s': 0.67, 'J9s': 0.66, 'T9s': 0.65\n            }\n\n            offsuit_strength = {\n                'AK': 0.90, 'AQ': 0.80, 'AJ': 0.70, 'AT': 0.60,\n                'KQ': 0.65, 'KJ': 0.62, 'KT': 0.58,\n                'QJ': 0.60, 'QT': 0.56, 'JT': 0.54,\n                ... \n            }\n\n        But note: we have two cards. We sort the ranks? and then check if same suit.\n\n        Example: ['Ks','Ah'] -> same as AKs? but we have to sort by rank: so ['A','K'] and then if same suit then 'AKs', else 'AK'.\n\n        We'll normalize the hand: sort by rank (descending) and then check suit.\n\n        Steps for the two hole cards:\n\n            ranks = sorted([card[0] for card in hole_cards], key=lambda x: rank_order[x], reverse=True)\n            if ranks[0] == ranks[1]:\n                hand_str = ranks[0]+ranks[1]   # 'AA'\n            else:\n                hand_str = ranks[0]+ranks[1]\n                if hole_cards[0][1] == hole_cards[1][1]:\n                    hand_str += 's'\n                else:\n                    hand_str += 'o'\n\n        Then we look up in the suited_strength or offsuit_strength? \n\n        But note: pairs don't have suited. So we can have a table for pairs and then for non-pairs.\n\n        We'll create one table for all:\n\n            preflop_strengths = {\n                'AA': 1.0,\n                'KK': 0.95,\n                'AKs': 0.92,\n                'AKo': 0.90,\n                'QQ': 0.88,\n                'JJ': 0.85,\n                'AQs': 0.83,\n                'AJo': 0.75,   # just an example, we need to build a table\n                ... \n            }\n\n        We'll build a table for the top 30 hands? And for the rest, we assign 0.5? \n\n        But note: we might have a hand not in the table? Then we assign 0.4? \n\n        We'll build a table for all 169 hands? That's too much? \n\n        Alternatively, we can compute the strength by:\n\n            score = 0\n            for card in hole_cards:\n                r = card[0]\n                score += rank_order[r]\n\n            if hole_cards[0][1] == hole_cards[1][1]:\n                score += 2   # suited bonus\n\n            if hole_cards[0][0] == hole_cards[1][0]:\n                score = score * 2   # pair? \n\n            Then normalize? \n\n        But note: AA should be 1.0. We can do:\n\n            max_score = 14+14+2 = 30? then normalized_score = score / max_score? \n\n        Then AA: (14+14)*2 / 30 = 56/30 = 1.86 -> but we want 1.0.\n\n        We can do: \n\n            pair_multiplier = 2\n            max_non_pair = 14+13+2 = 29\n            max_pair = (14+14)*2 = 56\n\n            So overall max = 56.\n\n            Then normalized = score / 56.\n\n        Then AA: 56/56=1.0, KK: (13+13)*2=52 -> 52/56=0.928, AKs: (14+13+2)=29 -> 29/56=0.517, AKo: (14+13)=27 -> 0.482.\n\n        But we know that AKs is stronger than KK? Actually, no, KK is stronger.\n\n        This method is not accurate.\n\n        We'll hardcode the top hands and assign the rest by a simple formula.\n\n        We'll create a table for the top 50 hands? \n\n        Due to time, we'll use a simple method: \n\n            preflop_strength = (highcard + lowcard) / 28  +  0.1 if suited + 0.1 if paired\n\n        Then AA: (14+14)/28 + 0.1 = 1.0+0.1=1.1 -> then we cap at 1.0? \n\n        Actually, we want between 0 and 1.\n\n        Let me do:\n\n            base = (rank_order[high] + rank_order[low]) / (28.0)   # 28 = 14+14\n            if high == low: # pair\n                result = base + 0.3\n            elif suited:\n                result = base + 0.15\n            else:\n                result = base\n\n            Then min is (2+3)/28 = 5/28 ~ 0.18, max is 14+14=28 -> 1.0 + 0.3 = 1.3 -> we clamp at 1.0.\n\n        We'll use:\n\n            result = min(1.0, (rank_order[high] + rank_order[low])/28.0 + (0.3 if high==low else 0.15 if suited else 0))\n\n        Example:\n            AA: (14+14)/28 = 1.0 + 0.3 = 1.3 -> clamp to 1.0.\n            AKs: (14+13)/28 = 0.964 + 0.15 = 1.114 -> clamp to 1.0.\n            AKo: (14+13)/28 = 0.964 -> 0.964.\n            KK: (13+13)/28 = 0.928 + 0.3 = 1.228 -> 1.0.\n            AQs: (14+12)/28 = 0.928 + 0.15 = 1.078 -> 1.0.\n\n        This method overrates many hands. \n\n        We'll try a different formula without clamping:\n\n            base = (rank_order[high] + rank_order[low]) / 28.0\n            bonus = 0\n            if high == low:\n                bonus = 0.3 * (base)   # so higher pairs get more bonus? \n            elif suited:\n                bonus = 0.15 * base\n\n            result = base + bonus\n\n        Then AA: 1.0 + 0.3*1.0 = 1.3 -> but we want to cap at 1.0? \n\n        We'll cap at 1.0.\n\n        Or we can scale by the maximum: AA: 1.3, then divide by 1.3? \n\n        Alternatively, we'll use the formula and then not cap? and then use relative thresholds.\n\n        We'll use the formula and adjust the thresholds accordingly.\n\n        We'll set:\n\n            fold_threshold = 0.4   # for pre-flop\n\n        Then a hand like 72o: (7+2)/28 = 0.321 -> then fold.\n\n        AKs: 0.964+0.15=1.114 -> then we use relative thresholds? \n\n        But note: our strategy thresholds (0.3, 0.5, 0.7) were designed for the hand strength in [0,1]. Now we have up to 1.3.\n\n        We can adjust the thresholds by scaling? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use the raw value and set thresholds accordingly.\n\n        We'll set:\n\n            fold_threshold = 0.4\n            call_threshold = 0.7\n            raise_threshold = 1.0\n\n        Then:\n            AA: 1.3 -> raise\n            AKs: 1.114 -> raise\n            AKo: 0.964 -> call\n            KQs: (13+12)/28 + 0.15 = 0.892+0.15=1.042 -> raise\n            QJs: (12+11)/28 +0.15 = 0.821+0.15=0.971 -> call\n            72o: 0.321 -> fold\n\n        This seems acceptable.\n\n 19. We'll implement the pre-flop hand strength function.\n\n 20. We'll also consider: \n        - If we are facing a raise, we should be more conservative? We'll use the same hand strength but adjust the thresholds up? \n\n        For example, if there was a raise before us, then we do:\n\n            fold_threshold = 0.6\n            call_threshold = 0.9\n            raise_threshold = 1.2\n\n        How do we know if there was a raise? \n            We can look at the round_state: \n                current_bet > big_blind_amount? But we don't know the big_blind_amount? \n\n        We can store the blind_amount from on_start, and then note that the opening bet pre-flop is the big blind. \n        If current_bet > self.blind_amount, then there has been at least one raise? \n\n        But note: there might be multiple raises, but we only care that there was a raise.\n\n        So:\n\n            if round_state.round == 'Preflop' and round_state.current_bet > self.blind_amount:\n                # there has been a raise\n                fold_threshold = self.raise_less_fold\n                call_threshold = self.raise_less_call\n                raise_threshold = self.raise_less_raise\n\n        We'll set thresholds for when there is a raise and when there isn't.\n\n        We'll define:\n\n            self.raise_less_fold = 0.6   # more conservative\n            self.raise_less_call = 0.9\n            self.raise_less_raise = 1.2\n\n            self.no_raise_fold = 0.4\n            self.no_raise_call = 0.7\n            self.no_raise_raise = 1.0\n\n        Then:\n\n            if raised: \n                fold_threshold = self.raise_less_fold\n                ...\n            else:\n                ...\n\n 21. We'll implement the hand evaluator for 5 cards and then extend to 7.\n\n 22. We'll write the code accordingly.\n\n 23. We must not forget: \n        - Error handling: the hand evaluator must be robust.\n        - We are given 30 seconds per move. The combination generation for 7 cards (21 combinations) should be fast.\n\n 24. We'll code accordingly.\n\n Due to the complexity and length, we'll code the essential parts and hope for the best.\n\n Let's code:"

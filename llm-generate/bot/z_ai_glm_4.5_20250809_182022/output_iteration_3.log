PROMPT:

You are tasked with submitting a poker bot to a No-Limit Texas Hold'em poker bot competition: Husky Hold'em.

**Detailed Game Rules**
- No-Limit Texas Hold'em with 2-10 players (often 6-handed tables); bots compete in heads-up or multi-player matches hosted by a central game server.
- Players start with $10,000 chips at the simulation start; simulations run for n games (more than 10 per run); blinds rotate and increase every n games (e.g., after certain rounds); big/small blinds are posted pre-flop.
- Goal: Maximize delta money (ending chips minus starting chips); if a player runs out of chips, they are eliminated from that table; no rebuys.
- Each hand has 4 betting rounds: Pre-flop (after hole cards and blinds), Flop (3 community cards), Turn (1 community card), River (1 community card).
- Actions: Fold, Check, Call, Raise (any amount up to stack, no limit), All-in.
- Hand rankings: Royal flush > Straight flush > Four of a kind > Full house > Flush > Straight > Three of a kind > Two pair > One pair > High card.
- Showdown: If multiple players remain after river betting, best 5-card hand (using any combination of 2 hole cards + 5 community cards) wins the pot; side pots form for all-ins with eligible players.
- Technical Limits: 30 seconds max per move (timeout causes automatic fold); 100MB max memory usage; any error/exception causes automatic fold; all bots are given the same compute limits.

Your task: Implement winning bot in player.py by subclassing Bot as in the template below and follow the above game rules.

Bot Design and Competition Rules:

1. Your bot must subclass Bot as SimplePlayer, implementing all required methods exactly as in the template. Preserve the class name SimplePlayer for compatibility with the game server. The template for the class is as
**SimplePlayer Template:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from bot import Bot
from type.poker_action import PokerAction
from type.round_state import RoundStateClient

class SimplePlayer(Bot):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        # TODO implement this

    def on_start(self, starting_chips: int, player_hands: List[str], blind_amount: int, big_blind_player_id: int, small_blind_player_id: int, all_players: List[int]):
        # TODO implement this

    def on_round_start(self, round_state: RoundStateClient, remaining_chips: int):
        # TODO implement this

    def get_action(self, round_state: RoundStateClient, remaining_chips: int) -> Tuple[PokerAction, int]:
        """ Returns the action for the player. """
        # TODO implement this

    def on_end_round(self, round_state: RoundStateClient, remaining_chips: int):
        """ Called at the end of the round. """
        # TODO implement this

    def on_end_game(self, round_state: RoundStateClient, player_score: float, all_scores: dict, active_players_hands: dict):
        # TODO implement this
```
2. DO NOT rename or remove any predefined methods (on_start, on_round_start, get_action, on_end_round, on_end_game), and do not change their signatures.
3. You may add helper functions and instance variables for strategy or tracking.
4. Your bot should be able to abide by no limit texas hold'em rules and handle side pots, all-ins, blind increases, multi-way pots, and be error-free (no exceptions).
5. For each action, always return valid actions:
    - For RAISE: the amount raise combine with your current bet must be larger than the the current raise.
    - For CALL: You don't need to specify the amount you call, it default to match exactly the amount needed to call (current_bet - your bet).
    - For CHECK: You can't check if round's current bet is larger than 0. Resort to other action (eg CALL, RAISE, ALL_IN).
    - For ALL_IN: You don't need to specify the amount you all in, it will default to all your current money.
    - **INVALID ACTION WILL MAKE YOU LOSE MONEY (automatic result in fold if the condition is not match for each action), so logic must always check bounds and edge cases**.
6. If you use any external libraries, they must be listed in requirements.txt (pure Python only).
7. Implement your bot with SimplePlayer. See full RoundStateClient, PokerAction, and PokerRound definitions below.
8. Your bot should maximize delta money (ending chips minus starting chips). Positive mean gaining money, the more money you gain the better.
9. There might will be data on previous run (error and game score) if this is not the first time you implement. If there is error, fix it so your bot can run. Try to improve your bot from previous round.
10. If there are no usage of external requirements, the text secion for requirement must be empty. DO NOT PUT ANYTHING ELSE. If you want to use any external library, you must put it in that text block
11. Your response must consist ONLY of two files: the complete player.py (as a Python code block) implementing the bot with all template elements preserved plus your improvements, and requirements.txt (as a text block) listing any dependencies (pure Python only, e.g., numpy if needed for calculations). Do not include any other text, explanations, or outputs. See example response below:
Example response:
```python
<Your python code>
```

```text
numpy
matplotlib
<any external library you want to use, put it here>
...
```
12. Your implementation MUST BE IN FULL not putting stub method or guideline. Everything in SimplePlayer must be ready to the detail and ready to run.
13. When you do division, make sure to make it prone to error divide by zero by adding some small delta.
14. The pool of submitted bots, including your bot, will be organized into 6-handed poker tables where every possible combination of 6 bots forms a separate table. Each table will play exactly 1,000 hands, with chip stacks carrying over between hands within the same table. 
15. At the end of each table, delta money is calculated for each bot using the formula: final chip count minus 10,000 (initial chip amount). Your bot's total tournament score is determined by summing its delta money across all tables it participates in. The bot with the highest cumulative delta money across all tables wins the tournament.
16. Your bot will undergo iterative testing across 5 rounds, where each round involves playing 10 hands of heads-up poker against a house bot. After each round, you will receive either the complete game log showing performance results or any compilation/simulation errors that occurred while attempting to run your bot. Use this feedback to refine your implementation in subsequent iterations.

        "reasoning": "We are given that the previous iteration resulted in an error: \"Empty response received from API\", which suggests that the previous code might have been incomplete or had an error that caused the API to not return a valid response.\n\nGiven the error, we need to ensure that the code is complete, follows the template exactly, and has no syntax or runtime errors.\n\nWe are building upon the previous iteration, but since we don't have the exact code of the previous iteration, we will create a robust implementation from scratch that:\n1. Follows the template exactly.\n2. Implements a basic but functional poker strategy that avoids common pitfalls (like invalid actions, timeouts, etc.).\n3. Handles all game situations (heads-up, multi-way, all-in, side pots, etc.) appropriately.\n4. Avoids any external libraries unless necessary (and if used, we list them in requirements.txt).\n\nGiven that we are in iteration 3, we should have learned from the errors in the previous iterations. The error \"Empty response\" might be because the entire response was empty? So we must ensure that we output the code and the requirements.txt block exactly as specified.\n\nWe'll design a bot that:\n- Starts with a simple hand evaluation (using handmade hand strength evaluation to avoid external libraries for now, but if we need one, we can use `pandas` for data structures? But let's try without first).\n- Tracks necessary state (like the current round, hole cards, etc.).\n- Makes decisions based on:\n   * The current betting round (preflop, flop, turn, river).\n   * The hand strength (using a helper function to evaluate the hand).\n   * The pot size and the current bet (to calculate pot odds).\n   * The opponents' actions (if available).\n\nWe'll break down the implementation:\n\n1. We'll create a helper function to evaluate the hand strength. We can represent the hand as a combination of hole cards and community cards. We'll write a function that returns a hand rank and the high card(s) for comparison.\n\n2. We'll implement a basic strategy:\n   - Preflop: Play tight (only raise with premium hands, call with moderate, fold otherwise).\n   - Postflop: Continue with strong hands or draws (considering pot odds for calling).\n\n3. We need to handle:\n   - Checking: if no bet has been made (current_bet == 0) and we are a late player.\n   - Calling: when facing a bet and we have a hand worth continuing (with pot odds).\n   - Raising: value betting our strong hands or bluffing in certain situations (but we must avoid being too aggressive to prevent big losses).\n   - Folding: when the hand is weak.\n\n4. We must be cautious of:\n   - All-in: when we have a strong hand and want to commit all chips.\n   - Side pots: but note that the game server handles side pots, so we just need to make decisions based on the pot we are eligible for.\n\n5. We'll also track the blinds and adjust for later positions (but without a full position tracking, we can use the `current_player` list to see who is left to act?).\n\nHowever, note that the state does not directly provide the position. We can try to infer the position from the `current_player` list and our player ID? But we don't have the full history. Instead, we can rely on the fact that we are the current player and the state tells us the current bet and the actions of others.\n\nWe'll design the `get_action` function:\n\nSteps in `get_action`:\n   a. If it's our turn, we look at the current round and community cards (plus our hole cards) to determine the strength of our hand.\n   b. We calculate the current cost to call (current_bet - our current bet in the round, which we can get from `player_bets`).\n   c. We calculate the pot odds (if any) for calling.\n   d. We decide on an action.\n\nWe'll write a helper function `evaluate_hand` that takes a list of hole cards and community cards and returns a hand rank (as a number) and the high cards for tie-breaking.\n\nWe'll use the standard hand ranking: \n   Royal flush: 10\n   Straight flush: 9\n   Four of a kind: 8\n   ... down to High card: 1\n\nBut note: we don't need the exact rank for comparison with opponents? We can use it to compare with a threshold for betting.\n\nAlternatively, we can precompute the hand strength as a hand rank and then use that to decide.\n\nGiven the complexity of hand evaluation, we can use a simplified method:\n\n   Step 1: Combine the 2 hole cards and 5 community cards (if available) to form a list of 7 cards.\n   Step 2: Generate all possible 5-card combinations from the 7 cards.\n   Step 3: For each 5-card hand, determine:\n        - if it's a flush (all same suit) and straight (consecutive ranks) -> straight flush or royal flush?\n        - then check four of a kind, etc.\n\nWe'll create a function `get_hand_rank` that returns a tuple (rank, high_cards) where:\n   rank: an integer from 1 to 10 (as above)\n   high_cards: a tuple of card ranks (in descending order) for tie-breaking (e.g., for a full house, we return (triple_rank, pair_rank))\n\nWe'll represent cards as strings, e.g., 'Ah' for Ace of hearts.\n\nWe'll map: \n   Ranks: '2' -> 2, ... 'T'->10, 'J'->11, 'Q'->12, 'K'->13, 'A'->14 (or 1 for ace in a straight? But we'll handle straight with ace as 14 and also as 1 when needed).\n\nBut note: we have to handle the ace as both high and low in straights.\n\nGiven the time constraints and the requirement to avoid external libraries, we'll write a simple hand evaluator.\n\nHowever, note that the hand evaluation might be heavy if we do combination generation? But 7 choose 5 is 21, so it's acceptable.\n\nBut we must be cautious of the 30-second time limit. This should be fast.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a lookup table? But without an external library, we write a simple one.\n\nWe'll create a helper class for card representation and then the hand evaluator.\n\nBut note: we are limited to 100MB memory, so we can precompute nothing? We do it on the fly.\n\nLet's write the hand evaluator:\n\nSteps for hand evaluator:\n\n   def evaluate_hand(hole_cards: List[str], community_cards: List[str]) -> Tuple[int, List[int]]:\n        all_cards = hole_cards + community_cards\n        if len(all_cards) < 5:\n            # Not enough cards, return high card\n            return (1, [high_card])\n\n        best_rank = 0\n        best_highs = []\n\n        for combination in itertools.combinations(all_cards, 5):\n            rank, highs = _evaluate_5_cards(combination)\n            if rank > best_rank or (rank == best_rank and highs > best_highs):\n                best_rank = rank\n                best_highs = highs\n\n        return (best_rank, best_highs)\n\n   Then write _evaluate_5_cards for 5 cards.\n\nWe'll write _evaluate_5_cards:\n\n   Steps:\n     1. Check for flush: all same suit?\n     2. Check for straight: sort the ranks, check consecutive? and also check for A-low straight (A,2,3,4,5).\n     3. Then check for multiples (pairs, three of a kind, etc.)\n\nBut note: we have to consider that the same card can be used for both flush and straight.\n\nWe'll map the card ranks to numbers: \n   '2' -> 2, '3'->3, ... '10'->10, 'J'->11, 'Q'->12, 'K'->13, 'A'->14.\n\nFor straight, we also have to consider the wheel (A,2,3,4,5) which is a straight with 5 as the highest? Actually, the straight A,2,3,4,5 is a 5-high straight, so we set the high card to 5.\n\nWe'll do:\n\n   ranks = sorted([rank_value(card) for card in cards], reverse=True)\n   suits = [suit(card) for card in cards]\n\n   Check flush: len(set(suits)) == 1\n   Check straight: \n        if sorted_ranks = sorted(ranks) -> but we have to account for duplicates? Actually, in a straight there are no duplicates.\n        Also, we have to account for the wheel: if the set is {14,2,3,4,5} then we have a straight (5-high).\n\n   We can do:\n        unique_ranks = sorted(set(ranks))   # but in a straight, we need consecutive and no duplicates? Actually, we have 5 distinct ranks.\n        if len(unique_ranks) == 5:\n            if unique_ranks[-1] - unique_ranks[0] == 4:\n                straight = True\n                high_straight = unique_ranks[-1]\n            elif set(unique_ranks) == {14,2,3,4,5}:\n                straight = True\n                high_straight = 5   # because the straight is 5-high\n        else:\n            straight = False\n\n   Then:\n        if straight and flush: return 9, [high_straight]   # but note: royal flush is a type of straight flush -> same rank? But we don't differentiate royal flush? Actually, royal flush is just the highest straight flush. So we can just use 9 and the high_straight for straight flush.\n\n        Else, check four of a kind: \n            count_ranks = Counter(ranks)\n            if 4 in count_ranks.values():\n                rank = 8\n                # get the rank that has 4, then the other card\n                quad_rank = [r for r, c in count_ranks.items() if c==4][0]\n                kicker = [r for r, c in count_ranks.items() if c==1][0]\n                return (8, [quad_rank, kicker])\n\n        Similarly for full house: 3 of a kind and 2 of a kind -> rank 7, then the triple rank then the pair.\n\n        Then flush: rank 6, then the ranks in descending order.\n\n        Then straight: rank 5, then the high_straight.\n\n        Then three of a kind: rank 4, then the triple rank, then the kickers in descending order.\n\n        Then two pair: rank 3, then the top pair, second pair, then kicker.\n\n        Then one pair: rank 2, then the pair rank, then kickers.\n\n        High card: rank 1, then the cards in descending order.\n\nBut note: we have to return the high cards in the order of importance for tie-breaking.\n\nThis hand evaluator will be the core of our bot.\n\nHowever, note that the hand evaluation function might be long and we are constrained by the 100MB and 30 seconds. We assume that 21 combinations per hand is acceptable.\n\nWe'll write the helper functions.\n\nBut note: we are not allowed to use external libraries? We can use itertools.combinations, which is in the standard library.\n\nWe'll use itertools.combinations.\n\nNow, the bot strategy:\n\n   We'll use:\n        pot_odds = current_cost_to_call / (pot + current_cost_to_call)   [if we are facing a bet]\n\n   And then compare the pot odds with our hand's winning probability? But without knowing the opponent's range, we can only use a threshold based on our hand strength.\n\n   Alternatively, we can set thresholds for each betting round and hand rank.\n\n   We'll define:\n        hand_rank_thresholds: \n            preflop: [0]  # we'll use the preflop hand strength (which is just the two hole cards) to decide.\n\n   For preflop, we can use a hand range by the two hole cards. We'll assign a value to the hole cards (e.g., using a precomputed table for starting hands).\n\n   However, to keep it simple, we'll use a function for preflop that returns a strength value.\n\n   We'll map:\n        Pocket pairs: AA=100, KK=90, ... 22=40.\n        Suited: \n            A with high suited: AKs=85, AQs=80, ... \n        Offsuit: \n            AKo=80, etc.\n\n   But without a table, we can write a function that returns a value.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the hand_rank function on the two hole cards? But that would be a two-card hand -> always high card? Not helpful.\n\n   Instead, we'll write a separate `preflop_strength` function that returns a score.\n\n   We'll define:\n        score = 0\n        ranks = sorted([rank_value(card) for card in hole_cards], reverse=True)\n        suits = [suit(card) for card in hole_cards]\n\n        if ranks[0] == ranks[1]:   # pocket pair\n            score = ranks[0] * 2 + 20\n        else:\n            gap = ranks[0] - ranks[1] - 1\n            if gap < 0: gap = 0   # shouldn't happen because sorted\n            # gap can be 0 to 12\n\n            base = ranks[0] + ranks[1]   # e.g., A K -> 14+13=27\n            # adjust for suited: add 5 if suited\n            if suits[0] == suits[1]:\n                base += 5\n            # adjust for gap: subtract gap*2? and more for larger gaps?\n            # We want: \n            #   no gap: base + 7\n            #   gap=1: base + 5 (because connected)\n            #   gap=2: base + 3\n            #   gap=3: base + 1\n            #   gap>=4: base - (gap-3)*2\n            if gap == 0:\n                base += 7\n            elif gap == 1:\n                base += 5\n            elif gap == 2:\n                base += 3\n            elif gap == 3:\n                base += 1\n            else:\n                base -= (gap-3)*2\n\n            score = base\n\n   Then we can set a threshold for raising, calling, folding.\n\n   But note: the preflop strength is arbitrary. We'll set:\n        raise if score >= 80 (only premium hands: AA, KK, AKs, QQ, AK, etc.)\n        call if score >= 50 (medium hands: AQ, AJ, KQ, etc. and maybe some others)\n        fold otherwise.\n\n   For postflop, we'll use the hand_rank and then:\n        We'll define a threshold per round: \n            flop: \n                hand_rank >= 6 (flush or straight or better) -> strong, we can raise\n                hand_rank >= 3 (two pair or better) -> medium, we can call\n                else fold? unless we have a draw? (but we are not calculating draws)\n\n        But we are not calculating draws, so we'll base on made hands.\n\n   This is a very basic strategy. We can improve by considering:\n        - The number of opponents: if multi-way, we need a stronger hand.\n        - The pot odds: if the pot is big and we have a marginal hand, we can call.\n\n   However, to keep the first version simple, we'll stick to hand strength.\n\n   We'll also adjust the bets: \n        When raising, we'll raise to 2-3 times the pot? But note no-limit, but we don't want to be too aggressive.\n\n   We'll set:\n        If we are raising, we'll raise an amount that is:\n            if preflop: 3 * big_blind (if no one has raised) or if there is a raise, we'll raise 3 times the current pot? \n            else: 2 * pot? \n\n   But we must check the min_raise and max_raise provided by the state.\n\n   We'll do:\n\n        min_raise = round_state.min_raise\n        max_raise = round_state.max_raise   # which is our remaining chips\n\n        We'll choose a raise amount between min_raise and max_raise.\n\n        Let base_raise = min_raise * 2   (but at least min_raise)\n\n        Then set raise_amount = min(base_raise, max_raise)\n\n        But if base_raise is more than our max_raise, we do all-in.\n\n   However, we want to avoid over-betting without a strong hand? So we might adjust by hand strength.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a fixed percentage of the pot: \n        raise_amount = int(pot * 0.75)   but note: min_raise might be more than that.\n\n   We must respect min_raise and max_raise.\n\n   So:\n\n        raise_amount = max(min_raise, min(int(pot * 0.75), max_raise))\n\n   But if we are raising, we must raise at least min_raise.\n\n   Alternatively, we can set:\n        If we have a strong hand (hand_rank>=8): we can go all-in? or raise a lot.\n        Else: we raise the minimum.\n\n   We'll do:\n\n        if hand_rank >= 8:   # four of a kind or better\n            # We want to build the pot, so we raise a lot: maybe 2 * pot? but capped by max_raise\n            raise_amount = min(2 * pot, max_raise)\n            if raise_amount < min_raise:\n                # then we do min_raise\n                raise_amount = min_raise\n        else:\n            raise_amount = min_raise   # minimum raise\n\n   Then return (PokerAction.RAISE, raise_amount)\n\n   Similarly, for all-in: we might choose to go all-in when we have a very strong hand and we think it's the best chance to get paid? Or if we are short-stacked.\n\n   But we'll use all-in only when we have a strong hand (hand_rank>=7) and the pot is big? Or when we are forced to? \n\n   We'll avoid all-in unless we have a monster hand or we are short-stacked (define short-stacked as remaining chips < 10 * big_blind? but we don't track big_blind in the state? The state has blind_amount in on_start, but we don't have it in round_state? So we need to store it).\n\n   We can store the big_blind in the bot instance.\n\n   We'll store:\n        self.big_blind = None   # set in on_start\n\n   Then in on_start:\n        self.big_blind = blind_amount   # but note: blind_amount might be the big blind? The parameters: \n            # blind_amount: the blind amount at the start? Actually, the parameters: \n            # on_start: starting_chips, player_hands, blind_amount, big_blind_player_id, small_blind_player_id, all_players\n\n        So blind_amount is the big blind? Or the small blind? The description says: \"blind_amount\" and then two player IDs for big and small.\n\n        Actually, the parameters: \n            blind_amount: the amount of the big blind? \n            But note: the blinds are small and big, so blind_amount might be the big blind? \n\n        We'll assume blind_amount is the big blind.\n\n   Then define short-stacked as: remaining_chips < 10 * self.big_blind.\n\n   Then when short-stacked and we have a hand rank>=5 (straight or better) we might push all-in.\n\n   But note: we are going to implement a simple version first and then improve.\n\n   We'll code accordingly.\n\n   Summary of the bot:\n\n   Instance variables:\n        self.id: set by set_id (we don't need to set it ourselves? the server sets it)\n        self.big_blind: the big blind amount at the start (might increase later? but we don't get updates? The state in round_state doesn't have blinds, so we need to track blind increases? But the state in on_round_start doesn't have blinds? So we cannot update. We'll use the initial big_blind and hope it doesn't change? Or the server will update via on_start? Actually, the blinds rotate and increase every n games, but we don't know if we get a new on_start when blinds increase? The problem says: \"blinds rotate and increase every n games\", and we are in a simulation of n hands. So the blinds might increase during the simulation.\n\n   How do we get the current big blind? The state we get in get_action does not have the blind amount. We have to track it.\n\n   The problem says: \"each hand has 4 betting rounds\" and \"blinds increase every n games\". We don't know when it increases. We must rely on the server to update via on_start? But on_start is called only once at the very beginning? Then we don't get updates.\n\n   We must check the parameters of on_round_start: it doesn't have the blind amount. So we cannot know when the blinds increase. Therefore, we cannot adjust for blind increases? \n\n   This is a problem. But note: the state in get_action has the current_bet and min_raise, which are in chips. So we can use these to decide without knowing the big blind? \n\n   We can remove the short-stacked definition by big blind? Instead, we can define short-stacked by the pot? Or we can avoid using the big blind in the strategy? \n\n   Alternatively, we can store the initial big_blind and then use that as a reference? But if blinds increase, our stored value is outdated.\n\n   We might have to abandon the short-stacked condition? Or we can use the current_bet as a reference? \n\n   We'll change: instead of using big_blind for short-stacked, we use the current pot? Or the current min_raise? \n\n   Actually, we can use the min_raise as a proxy: the min_raise is at least the big blind? \n\n   But note: the min_raise is the minimum raise amount, which is set by the rules (usually the big blind? or the last raise). It might be more than the big blind? \n\n   We'll define short-stacked as: remaining_chips < 10 * min_raise? \n\n   And then use that in our all-in condition.\n\n   We'll do:\n\n        if we are in get_action, and we have a hand_rank>=5 (straight or better) and our remaining_chips < 10 * round_state.min_raise:\n            we go all-in.\n\n   But note: we might not want to go all-in with a straight if the board is paired? But we are not analyzing the board for dangers. So we'll stick to hand rank.\n\n   We'll code accordingly.\n\n   Now, the structure of the code:\n\n   We'll write the hand evaluation functions first.\n\n   Then in the bot:\n\n        def on_start: \n            self.big_blind = blind_amount   # we store it, but we might not use it if blinds change? \n            # We'll store the initial big_blind, but note: we don't get updates. So we might not use it in the strategy? We'll avoid using it if we can.\n            # Instead, we can use the min_raise as a reference? \n            # We'll note that the min_raise at the start of a hand might be the big blind? \n\n        def on_round_start: \n            # We don't have the hole cards? Actually, in on_round_start, we get the round_state, which does not have the hole cards? \n            # How do we get the hole cards? They are provided in on_start? \n\n        We must store the hole cards: \n            In on_start: self.hole_cards = player_hands   (but note: player_hands is a list of one hand? because we are one player? The on_start parameter: player_hands: List[str] -> but each player gets two cards? How is it represented? \n\n        The parameter: player_hands: List[str] -> it is a list of hole cards for all players? But we only know our own? \n\n        Actually, the description says: \"player_hands: List[str]\" and in the template: \n            def on_start(self, starting_chips: int, player_hands: List[str], ...)\n\n        But note: the game server sends the hole cards for each player? But we only know our own? How do we know which one is ours? \n\n        The server sets our player ID via set_id, and then we should look for our own hand? \n\n        However, the on_start method does not specify which hand is ours. \n\n        We must assume that the list `player_hands` is indexed by player order? But we don't know the order. \n\n        Alternatively, the problem says: \"all_players: List[int]\" which is the list of player IDs. And the order of `all_players` matches the order of `player_hands`? \n\n        Then we can do:\n            index = all_players.index(self.id)\n            self.hole_cards = player_hands[index]   # but note: the hole cards are represented as a string? How? \n\n        The example: ['Ah', 'Ks', '3d'] for community cards, so hole cards might be represented as two strings? Or one string? \n\n        The parameter: player_hands: List[str] -> each element is a string? How are the two hole cards represented? \n\n        Example: \"Ah Ks\" or as a single string? We don't know.\n\n        Looking at the template and the example for community cards: they are a list of strings, each string is a card. \n\n        So the hole cards for a player should be two cards? Then how is it passed as a string? \n\n        The problem does not specify. We must assume that the hole cards for one player are passed as a list? But the parameter is List[str] for all players. \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"player_hands: List[str]\" and we are one player? But the list might be of length equal to the number of players? \n\n        And each element is a string representing the two hole cards? \n\n        Example: for player 0: \"Ah Ks\", player 1: \"3d 2c\", etc.\n\n        But note: the example response for community cards is a list of strings: ['Ah', 'Ks', '3d'] -> so they are separate. \n\n        Therefore, the hole cards for one player are two separate strings? Then why is the parameter List[str]? \n\n        This is confusing. \n\n        We must rely on the actual data structure. \n\n        Since the example community_cards is a list of strings, it is likely that the hole_cards for one player are also two strings? Then how are they passed in player_hands? \n\n        The parameter: player_hands: List[str] -> each player has one string? which might be the two cards concatenated? Or two strings? \n\n        But the type is List[str]. \n\n        We'll assume that the hole cards for one player are represented as a single string in the format: \"Ah Ks\" (two cards separated by space). \n\n        So we do:\n            self.hole_cards = player_hands[index].split()\n\n        But what if the string has no space? Then it might be one card? But we always get two hole cards. \n\n        Alternatively, the server might pass the hole cards as a list of two strings? Then the parameter should be List[List[str]]? But the type is List[str]. \n\n        This is a problem. \n\n        Given the ambiguity, we must look at the actual data provided in the previous iterations? But we don't have any. \n\n        We'll make an assumption: \n\n            The on_start parameter: player_hands is a list of strings, each string is two cards represented as two two-character strings without space? Like \"AhKs\"? \n\n        Or with space? \n\n        We'll assume that the server sends a string with two cards separated by space. \n\n        So we split by space.\n\n        But note: the community cards are sent as a list of strings, so why hole cards are sent as a string? \n\n        Alternatively, the server might send a list of two strings for each player? Then the parameter would be List[List[str]]? But the type is List[str]. \n\n        This is a critical point. \n\n        Since the problem states that we are building upon the previous iteration and we had an error, we must fix the data representation issue if it exists.\n\n        But without data, we assume that the hole cards for one player are passed as a string of two cards separated by space. \n\n        So we do:\n\n            self.hole_cards = player_hands[index].split()\n\n        If we get a list of two strings, then we don't need to split? \n\n        We can check the length of the element? If the element is a string of length 5 (like \"Ah Ks\") then we split. If it is a list of two strings, then the parameter would be passed as a list of two strings? But the type is List[str] for the whole player_hands. \n\n        How is the game server sending the data? \n\n        Given the ambiguity, we can try to be flexible:\n\n            If the element is a string of length 5 (with a space) then split.\n            If the element is a string of length 4 (without space) then we break into two strings of two characters.\n\n        Example: \"AhKs\" -> ['Ah','Ks'].\n\n        We'll do:\n\n            hand_str = player_hands[index]\n            if len(hand_str) == 4:\n                # no space\n                self.hole_cards = [hand_str[0:2], hand_str[2:4]]\n            else:\n                self.hole_cards = hand_str.split()\n\n        But note: the card representation is two characters: rank and suit. So two cards are 4 characters? But if there's a space, then 5 characters? \n\n        Alternatively, we can split by any non-alphanumeric? But it's simpler to split by space and if we get one string, then break it.\n\n        We'll do:\n\n            self.hole_cards = hand_str.split()\n            if len(self.hole_cards) == 1:\n                # then it's one string, so we break into two\n                s = self.hole_cards[0]\n                if len(s) == 4:\n                    self.hole_cards = [s[0:2], s[2:4]]\n                else:\n                    # error? but we expect two cards\n                    self.hole_cards = [s[0:2], s[2:4]]   # try anyway, ignoring extra? \n\n        We'll hope it's two cards.\n\n   Now, we write the hand evaluation functions.\n\n   We'll write:\n\n        def _get_card_rank(card: str) -> int:\n            rank_char = card[0]\n            if rank_char == 'A':\n                return 14\n            elif rank_char == 'K':\n                return 13\n            elif rank_char == 'Q':\n                return 12\n            elif rank_char == 'J':\n                return 11\n            elif rank_char == 'T':\n                return 10\n            else:\n                return int(rank_char)\n\n        def _get_card_suit(card: str) -> str:\n            return card[1]\n\n        def _evaluate_5_cards(cards: List[str]) -> Tuple[int, List[int]]:\n            # cards: list of 5 strings\n            ranks = sorted([_get_card_rank(card) for card in cards], reverse=True)\n            suits = [card[1] for card in cards]\n\n            # Check flush\n            is_flush = len(set(suits)) == 1\n\n            # Check straight\n            unique_ranks = sorted(set(ranks))\n            is_straight = False\n            high_straight = 0\n\n            if len(unique_ranks) == 5:\n                if unique_ranks[-1] - unique_ranks[0] == 4:\n                    is_straight = True\n                    high_straight = unique_ranks[-1]\n                elif set(unique_ranks) == {14, 2, 3, 4, 5}:\n                    is_straight = True\n                    high_straight = 5\n            # But note: the above set doesn't work because unique_ranks is sorted. \n            # We can check: \n            #   if unique_ranks == [14,2,3,4,5] -> but sorted(set(ranks)) would be [2,3,4,5,14] -> not consecutive.\n            # We can do:\n            if not is_straight and set(unique_ranks) == {14, 2, 3, 4, 5}:\n                is_straight = True\n                high_straight = 5\n\n            # If straight and flush -> straight flush\n            if is_straight and is_flush:\n                return (9, [high_straight])\n\n            # Count rank occurrences\n            from collections import Counter\n            count_rank = Counter(ranks)\n            count_rank_val = sorted(count_rank.values(), reverse=True)\n\n            # Four of a kind\n            if count_rank_val[0] == 4:\n                quad_rank = [rank for rank, count in count_rank.items() if count==4][0]\n                kicker = [rank for rank, count in count_rank.items() if count==1][0]\n                return (8, [quad_rank, kicker])\n\n            # Full house\n            if count_rank_val[0] == 3 and count_rank_val[1] == 2:\n                triple_rank = [rank for rank, count in count_rank.items() if count==3][0]\n                pair_rank = [rank for rank, count in count_rank.items() if count==2][0]\n                return (7, [triple_rank, pair_rank])\n\n            # Flush\n            if is_flush:\n                return (6, sorted(ranks, reverse=True))\n\n            # Straight (we already checked, so we do this only if not flush?

We'll now write the rest of the methods.\n\n   We'll also add error handling to ensure we always return an action.\n\n   We'll catch any exception and return FOLD (with 0) to avoid automatic fold due to exception.\n\n   So in get_action:\n\n        try:\n            ... the above logic ...\n\n        except Exception as e:\n            # Log the error? but we cannot print? \n            return (PokerAction.FOLD, 0)\n\n   We'll also implement the other methods as stubs.\n\n   For on_end_round and on_end_game, we don't do anything yet.\n\n   We'll write:\n\n        def on_start(self, starting_chips: int, player_hands: List[str], blind_amount: int, big_blind_player_id: int, small_blind_player_id: int, all_players: List[int]):\n            self.big_blind = blind_amount\n            # Find our own hand\n            index = all_players.index(self.id)\n            hand_str = player_hands[index]\n            # Split hand_str into two cards\n            if len(hand_str) == 4:\n                self.hole_cards = [hand_str[0:2], hand_str[2:4]]\n            else:\n                # Try splitting by space\n                self.hole_cards = hand_str.split()\n                if len(self.hole_cards) == 1:\n                    # Then try to break the single string\n                    s = self.hole_cards[0]\n                    if len(s) >= 4:\n                        self.hole_cards = [s[0:2], s[2:4]]\n                    else:\n                        # This is an error, but we'll set to dummy\n                        self.hole_cards = ['??','??']   # dummy, will cause errors in hand evaluation? but we try to avoid.\n\n        def on_round_start(self, round_state: RoundStateClient, remaining_chips: int):\n            # We don't do anything for now\n            pass\n\n        def on_end_round(self, round_state: RoundStateClient, remaining_chips: int):\n            pass\n\n        def on_end_game(self, round_state: RoundStateClient, player_score: float, all_scores: dict, active_players_hands: dict):\n            pass\n\n   This completes the bot.\n\n   We note: the hand evaluation for 7 cards might be heavy? But 21 combinations is light.\n\n   We'll hope it works.\n\n   We'll also note: we are not using any external libraries? We use itertools.combinations and collections.Counter, which are standard.\n\n   Therefore, requirements.txt can be empty.\n\n   Let's output the code accordingly.\n\n   IMPORTANT: The previous iteration had an error \"Empty response\", so we must ensure the response is not empty. \n\n   We'll write the entire player.py code in one block.\n\n   We'll also include the helper functions inside the class? Or outside? \n\n   We'll put the helper functions inside the class as static methods? Or as private methods? \n\n   We'll put them as private methods (prefixed with _) in the class.\n\n   But note: the hand evaluator functions are only used in get_action. We'll put them as private methods.\n\n   We'll write:\n\n        class SimplePlayer(Bot):\n            def __init__(self):\n                super().__init__()\n                self.big_blind = None\n                self.hole_cards = None\n\n            ... other methods ...\n\n            def _get_card_rank(self, card: str) -> int:\n                ...\n\n            def _get_card_suit(self, card: str) -> str:\n                ...\n\n            def _evaluate_5_cards(self, cards: List[str]) -> Tuple[int, List[int]]:\n                ...\n\n            def evaluate_hand(self, hole_cards: List[str], community_cards: List[str]) -> Tuple[int, List[int]]:\n                ...\n\n            def preflop_strength(self, hole_cards: List[str]) -> int:\n                ...\n\n            def get_action(self, round_state: RoundStateClient, remaining_chips: int) -> Tuple[PokerAction, int]:\n                ...\n\n   But note: the method `evaluate_hand` and `preflop_strength` are not required to be in the interface, so we can define them as private? We'll leave them as public? But they are not used outside.\n\n   We'll make them private for encapsulation.\n\n   We'll write the entire code.\n\n   We'll also note: the `get_action` method must return a tuple (PokerAction, int). For FOLD, CHECK, CALL, ALL_IN: the amount is not used, but we return 0. For RAISE, we return the amount.\n\n   For ALL_IN, we return 0? because the server uses the entire stack. But note: the template says: \n        - For ALL_IN: You don't need to specify the amount you all in, it will default to all your current money.\n\n   So we return 0.\n\n   Similarly for CALL, we return 0.\n\n   For FOLD, we return 0.\n\n   Only for RAISE we return the amount.\n\n   We are ready.\n\n   We'll output the code."
